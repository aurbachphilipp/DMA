At the completion of the S2MM transfer, the number of actual bytes written on the S2MM AXI4 interface is updated to the S2MM_LENGTH register.
Note: This value must be greater than or equal to the largest expected packet to be received on S2MM AXI4-Stream. Values smaller than the received packet result in undefined behavior.
